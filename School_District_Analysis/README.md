## An Introduction to Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of the Project
In this module activity we were introduced to Jupyter notebook and the pandas library for python.  To practice with these new tools we helped "Maria" extrapolate and analyze data about funding and standardized test scores collected from all of the schools in a school district.  From this data analysis, the school board should be able to make decisions about future budgeting.  To prepare the data, we had to first check each of our data sets for any missing or inaccurate information.  Once complete, we merged the data about the students and schools into one complete dataset.  Finally, we were able to run some statistical measures to evaluate if there was any correlation between standardized test scores and school size, spending per student, and/or type of school (district vs charter).  However, After we completed our module we became aware of a potential issue with scholastic dishonesty within one of the schools.  So, we were asked to remove the potentially compromised data and rerun our analysis.
